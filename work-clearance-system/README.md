## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server or build tools required

### Installation
1. Download or clone the prototype files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. The application will initialize automatically

### Usage

#### Creating a Work Request
1. Click "New Work Request" button
2. Fill out the 3-step form wizard:
   - **Basic Info**: Title, department, work type, priority, description
   - **Location & Risk**: Location, duration, affected infrastructure, safety measures
   - **Schedule & Approval**: Start/end dates, emergency contact, cost, attachments
3. Submit the request for approval

#### Managing Requests
- **View Details**: Click on any request row to see full details
- **Filter Requests**: Use status and department filters
- **Approve/Reject**: Use action buttons for pending requests
- **Track Progress**: Monitor approval workflow and timeline

#### Dashboard Features
- **Statistics Cards**: Pending, active, completed requests, and risk alerts
- **Recent Notifications**: Latest updates and alerts
- **Quick Actions**: Emergency stop, campus alerts, reports

## Business Rules

### Work Types and Risk Levels
- **Low Risk**: General maintenance, landscaping
- **Medium Risk**: Electrical work, plumbing, road work, telecom
- **High Risk**: Excavation/digging, construction

### Approval Workflow
- **Low Risk**: Department supervisor approval
- **Medium Risk**: Supervisor + Infrastructure manager + Technical specialist
- **High Risk**: All above + Safety officer + Administrative head

### Infrastructure Protection
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Fiber optic cables, power lines, water pipes, gas lines
- **Non-Critical**: Telecom cables, drainage, internet cables
- **Safety Measures**: Automatically generated based on risk level and work type

### Priority Levels
- **Low**: Routine maintenance, non-urgent work
- **Medium**: Standard repairs and installations
- **High**: Important infrastructure work
- **Urgent**: Emergency repairs, safety-critical work

## Mock Data

The prototype includes realistic mock data:
- **25 Sample Work Requests** with various statuses and priorities
- **8 Departments** with contact information
- **8 Work Types** with different risk levels
- **7 Infrastructure Types** with criticality levels
- **10 Campus Locations** with coordinates for mapping
- **Approval Chains** based on work type requirements
- **Safety Measures** automatically generated by risk level

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + N`: New work request
- `Ctrl + M`: Show campus map
- `Ctrl + R`: Show reports
- `Ctrl + S`: Show settings
- `Ctrl + /`: Show keyboard shortcuts help
- `Escape`: Close modal or dropdown

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: 60+
- **Firefox**: 55+
- **Safari**: 12+
- **Edge**: 79+

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **ES6+ Features**: Modern JavaScript syntax and APIs
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques
- **Local Storage**: Client-side data persistence
